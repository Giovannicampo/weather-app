# Weather.io

Weather.io is a web application, developed in React and Typescript, that provides weather forecast and stats.

## Requirements of the app
The application has been designed in order to show with ease weather stats by choosing one of the following three options: 
- *Current weather*, a page where the user can view the current weather data of a selected location;
- *Forecast*, a page that shows forecast for at maximum 7 days of a selected location. 
- *History*, a page that shows forecast of a selected location in the past;

Furthermore, it is possible to save favorite locations and to view their current weather and forecast in a dedicated section.
